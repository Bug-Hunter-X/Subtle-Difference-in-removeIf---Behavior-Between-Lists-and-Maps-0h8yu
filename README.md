This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error when using the `removeIf` function in Kotlin with Lists and Maps.  The core issue lies in the way `removeIf` interacts with the underlying data structure.  While it functions as expected with Lists, removing elements directly, it displays unexpected behavior with Maps. This difference can lead to confusion and unexpected results if not properly understood. The solution provides a corrected approach ensuring intended behavior for both.
